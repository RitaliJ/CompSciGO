Hi guys! Welcome to CSGO. Here's how it works.

When the user (maybe a teacher) clicks on "Host Game," a new game is created, and a unique game code is created.

The players can then click "Play Game" and enter the game code to join the host's game. They also enter their name, which is displayed on the next screen.

The next screen is an array of stars. Whenever a player joins, one star lights up (turns yellow), and their name is displayed on the star.

When the host is satisfied with the number of players, they can click the "Start Game" button to start the game.

After the game starts, players will see questions on their screen. They will be given 4 answer choices. They can click one answer choice, and the answer choice will turn green (if correct) and red (if incorrect). If the answer choice is incorrect, the correct one will turn green.

After the player has answered 10 questions, they will be taken to the waiting screen. They can click the buttons to move the avatar around the waiting screen. The up, down, left, and right buttons correspond to their respective directions, and the stop button will stop the avatar from moving.

Meanwhile, the host can start the boss battle from their screen at any point in the game, even if not all the students have finished the questions.

When the boss battle starts, the players will see a final question appear on their screen. If they answer it correctly, they'll see a picture of them beating up the boss. If they answer it wrong, they'll see a picture of the boss beating them up.

In order for the whole class to win against the boss, at least 80% of the class must get the final question correct.
